# Adapter Design Pattern < in branch adapter >

Thee code breaks the SOLID principles because :
  1- There is no responsability for each class or for each methode , becÿ¥ase all methods implements in the same class which name "Connection" 
  2- There is no open-close feature , because any modification will be made to the code, I will modify it in every method
  3- Threr is no interface to use it if I want to add a new class
  
  So to solve all these problem i am using **Singleton , Factory , Adapter Design Patterns**  :
  1- Create "Connection" interface 
  2- Create singleton class for each protocol and each class implements from the "Connection" interface
  3- Create "ConnectionFactory" class will connect the client side with the interface and classes 
  4- Creta "NewConnection" New Interface 
  5- create new singleton class which implements from NewConnection
  6- Create "ConnectionAdapter" class implements from NewConnection , which will use to connect

Connection class used to create a connection via ssh, telnet, http, scp and ftp protocols.THis class will use some of singleton design pattern properties m like i can;t crearte object from this class in another class by the constructor. THis class contaion 5 private static instance for eache protocol , also contain 6 methods which is :<br/>
1- **Connection() : void**-> constructor  <br/>
2- **getInstance(String) : Connection** -> to get connection as the protocol which in the parameter <br/>
3- **createConnection(Connection , String) : Connection** -> to create new connection if does not exist and #connections still less than 3 <br/>
4- **releaseByParameter(String) : boolean** -> to remove connection according to protocol which in the parameter <br/>
5- **releaseByObject() : boolean** -> to remove connection according to the object call the function <br/>
6- **getCurrentConnections() : List**<String> -> to return all protocols have a connection has been created as a list <br/>
7-  **send(String) : void** -> to send message to the user as the object which call the function <br/>
